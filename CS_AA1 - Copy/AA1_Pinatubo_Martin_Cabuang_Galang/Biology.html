    <h1 class="text-center" style="font-family: 'Prata', serif;">Digestive System</h1>

    <p>Understanding how our digestive system works is essential, as the intake of food is one of the most important and
      frequently done activities within our body, it is only reasonable to be able to learn and explain how our body
      does such a task, from the basic pathway to the complex enzymes and cells involved in converting food to usable
      energy. This simulation activity gives us a more concrete idea on how the digestion process goes aside from just
      using presentations and written work. Hands-on activities with common materials and methods provide the students
      with a better understanding of what exactly goes on in their bodies. After all, experience is the best teacher.</p>
      <br><br>

    <div class="section-container section-1">
      <h1 class="mt-3"><b>Stages of Food Processing</b></h1>
      <hr>
      <h2><b><u>CRUSHING STAGE</u></b></h2>

      <div class="sob">
        <video controls width="400" height="250" muted>
          <source src="images/crushing.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
      </div>

      <p>The crushing stage of the experiment represented the stomach using the ziploc, while the bananas and crackers represented food. The food being placed in the ziploc represented the food going inside the mouth. We added water later on, which represents saliva, making the food more soft and soluble in the stomach. When we crushed and mashed the components of the bag together, it represented the mechanical digestion of the stomach, as it only involved the physical breakdown of food. The addition of calamansi juice later on represented the acid in our stomach, wearing down the food into smaller bits even more and “changing” how the chemical components of the food were. We believe that the biomolecule components involved within the food are the ones that we also see in the food we usually digest; carbohydrates, lipids, proteins and even nucleic acid.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2><b><u>TRANSFER STAGE</u></b></h2>
      <div class="sob">
        <video controls width="400" height="300" muted>
          <source src="images/squeeze.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
      </div>

      <p>Next, the transfer stage. The stocking represents the small intestine, as it has a “filter” that keeps and releases the nutrients (crushed and mushed food) into the body (the tray). After we squeezed out the contents onto the body, we observed some solids in the stocking, which represented the leftover / indigestible substances from the food. Lastly, pushing out the partially solidified content represented the excretion of indigestible substances from the intestines and out the anus.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-3"><b><u>SIMULATION OF ABSORPTION</u></b></h2>

      <div class="sob">
        <video controls width="400" height="300" muted>
          <source src="images/tissues.mp4" type="video/mp4">

      </div>

      <p>The paper towel that absorbed the most water was the one that was folded four times. This could be because of the multiple layers it had that could take in more water than a towel with only one layer. We could compare the towels to the large intestine which is responsible for water and electrolyte absorption.
        The folds of the paper towel may simulate the segmented structure of the large intestine due to its folds called
        haustrae which similar to the paper towels helps it absorb more water.</p>

    <div class="section-container section-3">
      <h2 class="mt-3"><b><u>SIMULATION OF BILE ACTION</u></b></h2>

      <p>The bile is in a form of mechanical digestion, as it involves the physical breakdown of large fat globules
        into smaller, more accessible particles for enzymatic digestion to occur. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-container conclusion">
      <h2 class="mt-3"><b><u>CONCLUSION</u></b></h2>
      <p>The activity simulated and simplified the digestion process in our body; from food being mechanically crushed in
        our stomach, to it being “absorbed” by the body through the intestines, and the little remains coming out at the
        end. The experiment gave us a better understanding of how our body breaks down food; Though it isn't perfect, it
        gave us a very clear and general idea of how the process goes due to its simplicity. Its relevance in the real
        world allows us and those who have lesser information on how the digestive system works to understand it
        better, again because of the limited resources, techniques, and the clarity of the task.</p>
